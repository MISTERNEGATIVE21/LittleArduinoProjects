# #656 Crystal-Locked Schmitt Oscillator

Testing a basic crystal-locked Schmitt oscillator using a 74HC14.

## Notes

I tested the basic SchmittOscillator a very long time ago in [LEAP#022](../SchmittOscillator).
I was prompted to try the crystal-locked variation after seeing CD40106 aka 74C14 covered in IMSAI Guy's chip of the day:

### Circuit Design

the slowest crystal I have to hand is 4MHz, so I needed to add 20pF stabilization capacitors to maintain oscilation.
The second inverter buffers the output and the 51kÎ© feedback resistor ensure's the oscillator is kicked into action.
