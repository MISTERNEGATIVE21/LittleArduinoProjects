Note: with this motor and propeller, I needed the motor connected in "reverse" for correct prop rotation.

### Build Log

This is how I started - just past 7:30pm Singapore UTC+8.
I've got the Wingsy Kits A5M2b "Claude" (early version) a micro motor, a pilot stolen from anther kit and a frame I'm planning to use for mounting.

![fri-night-start](./assets/fri-night-start.jpg?raw=true)

![build01a](./assets/build01a.jpg?raw=true)
![build01b](./assets/build01b.jpg?raw=true)
![build01c](./assets/build01c.jpg?raw=true)
![build01d](./assets/build01d.jpg?raw=true)

we have ignition! motorising was a stretch goal, but the way Wingsey have designed the engine makes it quite easy to mount a micro motor .. controlled by a microprocessor .. it's a micro machine;-)

![build01e](./assets/build01e.jpg?raw=true)

engine detail coming together!

![build01f](./assets/build01f.jpg?raw=true)

Saying goodnight from UTC+8 for now and see you all in the morning. Great time so far - caught the live streams starting with Oz and it got me moving. Got most of the subassemblies ready: have ignition; got air! Hopefully it'll all just fall together tomorrow. As I write, the fund-raiser is already 15% to the goal .. and the event hasn't even "started" yet. That is pretty amazing!

![fri-night-close](./assets/fri-night-close.jpg?raw=true)


a bit of head-scratching later and I figured out how all the engine parts fit together!

![build01g](./assets/build01g.jpg?raw=true)


![build02a](./assets/build02a.jpg?raw=true)
![build02b](./assets/build02b.jpg?raw=true)
![build02c](./assets/build02c.jpg?raw=true)
![build02d](./assets/build02d.jpg?raw=true)
![build02e](./assets/build02e.jpg?raw=true)
![build02f](./assets/build02f.jpg?raw=true)
![build02g](./assets/build02g.jpg?raw=true)
![build02h](./assets/build02h.jpg?raw=true)
![build02i](./assets/build02i.jpg?raw=true)


a pity it's all going to be hidden away, but I blew my morning time budget on the cockpit. the kit makes it pretty irresistible!

![build02j](./assets/build02j.jpg?raw=true)

![build03a](./assets/build03a.jpg?raw=true)
![build03b](./assets/build03b.jpg?raw=true)
![build03c](./assets/build03c.jpg?raw=true)

finally closed up the fuselage

![build03d](./assets/build03d.jpg?raw=true)

Since the plane is in-flight, I need a pilot! I stole this from the Tamiya Ki-61 Hien kit and did a rapid paint job. I have a feeling the flying kit is a little too advanced for the Claude but, hey..

![build04b](./assets/build04b.jpg?raw=true)
![build04c](./assets/build04c.jpg?raw=true)

![build05a](./assets/build05a.jpg?raw=true)
![build05b](./assets/build05b.jpg?raw=true)
![build05c](./assets/build05c.jpg?raw=true)

not enough time to paint my own background, so I tropical storm  picture from a calendar (shot in Darwin actually)

![build05d](./assets/build05d.jpg?raw=true)

put the electronics on protoboard and installed in the rear of the frame

![build05f](./assets/build05f.jpg?raw=true)

stuck on the wall (to give it time to cure before I add the load of the plane)

![build05g](./assets/build05g.jpg?raw=true)

a few coats of H8 later and I'm ready to call it a night (Sat). Just got final paint, decals weathering and installation for Sunday. Pretty confident of finishing this in 48 now!

![sat-night-close](./assets/sat-night-close.jpg?raw=true)

painting the tail

canopy closed up and now starting to wrangle the wiring

![build07b](./assets/build07b.jpg?raw=true)

mounted and wiring up..
